gngr
====

This is the source code of [gngr](https://gngr.info), a new cross-platform browser that champions privacy. `gngr`
is an independent implementation of web standards in pure Java. It is *not* a wrapper around other browser engines.
Read [the introduction](https://gngr.info/doc/introduction.html) to know more.

### Status
This is an early prototype that is usable with simple websites.

Security-wise, the code isn't hardened *at all!* Use the current version:
 * with [app level sandboxing](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/App-Sandboxing) 
 * with simple, trusted web-sites only
 * periodically [clear the browser cache and data](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/Clearing-cache-and-data).

**Do Not use the current version with critical websites such as banking websites or web-mail.**

### Pre-History
`gngr` began as a fork of the now-defunct project called the `lobo` browser (see [credits](https://gngr.info/doc/credits.html)).
For archival purposes, the history of all commits that transform `lobo` code from its CVS repository to the very first version of gngr is available in [a separate repository](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngrPreHistoric).
