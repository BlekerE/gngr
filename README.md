gngr
====

This is the source code of [gngr](https://gngr.info), a new cross-platform browser that champions privacy.

### Status
This is a very early prototype; a mere proof-of-concept. It is useable with very simple websites. Use at your own risk;
there is no warranty, implied or specified.

Security-wise, the code isn't hardened *at all!* Use the current version:
 * with [app level sandboxing](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/App-Sandboxing) 
 * with simple trusted web-sites only
 * periodically [clear the browser cache and data](https://github.com/UprootLabs/gngr/wiki/Clearing-cache-and-data).

**Do Not use the current version with critical websites such as banks or web-mails.**

### Contributing
We need help in testing the browser and in triaging bug reports. We also need expert advice.

At the moment we are not prepared for code contributions since there are major architectual changes afoot. If you would
like to contribute code, discuss with us first, before you spend effort on it.

Read [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.
